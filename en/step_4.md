## Using Your Own Photos, Without a Camera

If you don't have a camera, then you can still use your own photos by uploading them to your notebook.

You cannot do this using Wolfram in a browser, only on the desktop application, or on a Raspberry Pi computer.

In order to load an image directly from your computer, you will need to make two buttons. The first button is automatically generated by using `FileNameSetter`. This function automatically creates a variable with the name of the file you select. When you press the button, a pop up will appear, allowing you to locate and choose your image. `FileNameSetter` will then remember the path to the image you have selected.

You then need a second button to actually load the image you select, using `Import`.

Once the file path has been set, and the file has been imported, you can show the image using `Dynamic`.

--- task ---
Create two buttons, one which sets the file path using `FileNameSetter`, and one which loads the file to the notebook.
Show the image using `Dynamic`.

```
FileNameSetter[Dynamic[file], Appearance -> "Select New Image"]
Button["Load file", image = Import[file]]
Dynamic[image]
```
--- /task ---
