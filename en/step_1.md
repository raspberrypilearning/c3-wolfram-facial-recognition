+ Using `Classify` to build simple machine learning classifications
+ Using Wolfram to take photos
+ Using buttons and `Dynamic` to create interactivity

If you have never used the Wolfram Language before, follow [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-mathematica). You'll need to look at Starting Mathematica and Programming in Mathematica. If you are using the web browser version of Wolfram, you only need to look at Programming in Mathematica.
